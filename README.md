# Vite Project Installation and Running Guide

Welcome to the Vite project! Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/DipeshK47/PlateUp_task)>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd plateup
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

1. **Start the Development Server**

   Use the following command to run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and you should see output indicating that the server is running.

2. **Open Your Browser**

   By default, the development server runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to view your project.

## Additional Information

- **Scripts**: The `package.json` file contains various scripts for different tasks. Check the `scripts` section for more commands you can use.
- **Configuration**: The Vite configuration can be found in `vite.config.js`. Modify it according to your project needs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts**: If the default port `3000` is in use, you can change the port in the `vite.config.js` file or by using an environment variable.
- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed. You may need to clear the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies if issues persist.
